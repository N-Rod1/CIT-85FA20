        <p>Some say the world will end in fire,</p>
        <p>Some say in ice.</p>
        <p>From what I’ve tasted of desire</p>
        <p>I hold with those who favor fire</p>
        <p>But if it had to perish twice,</p>
        <p>I think I know enough of hate</p>
        <p>To say that for destruction ice</p>
        <p>Is also great</p>
        <p>And would suffice.</p>

        <p>I’ve tried the new moon tilted in the air</p>
        <p>Above a hazy tree-and-farmhouse cluster</p>
        <p>As you might try a jewel in your hair.</p>
        <p>I’ve tried it fine with little breadth of luster</p>
        <p>Alone, or in one ornament combining</p>
        <p>With one first-water star almost as shining</p>
        <p>I put it shining anywhere I please.</p>
        <p>By walking slowly on some evening later,</p>
        <p>I’ve pulled it from a crate of crooked trees...</p>
